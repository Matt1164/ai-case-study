 TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* BullfrogAI

* 2017

* Vin Singh

* BullfrogAI originated within John Hopkins university AI department

* initially funded with small grants, the company decided to go public via the NASDAQ stock market and raised 8 million dollars from its IPO?

## Business Activities

* Bullfrog's platform technology, named, bfLEAP™, is an analytical AI/ML platform derived from technology developed at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL), which is able to surmount the challenges of scalability and flexibility currently hindering researchers and clinicians by providing a more precise1, multi-dimensional understanding of their data.  * Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* Most current AI/ML platforms still fall short in their ability to synthesize disparate, high-dimensional data for actionable insight 

* The bfLEAP™ platform utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning – as such, it is able to reveal real/meaningful connections in the data without the need for a prior hypothesis. Supervised machine learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not. In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Algorithms used in the bfLEAP™ platform are designed to handle highly imbalanced data sets to successfully identify combinations of factors that are associated with outcomes of interest.  ## Landscape

* Biotechnology

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* Some other companies in this fiend are Abcellera, Schrödinger, and BenevolentAI. 
  ## Results

* The company just went public in 2023 so it's impact is limited.  Its success mostly relies upon partnerships with Big Pharma

 How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* The company is underperforming based on its inability to secure a big pharma partner as of yet.

## Recommendations

* My advice to the company would be to develop a better sales team, increase investor awareness thorugh conferences and not allow any insider sales until some meaningful partnerships are in place.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?  This will keep the share price from going down until some partnerships are developed.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? n/a

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? n/a
